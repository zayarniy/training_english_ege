There is cross-disciplinary agreement on defining Critical Thinking as the ability to evaluate the content of information and to derive conclusions about the extent to which one can believe this information or discuss what one should think of it. Especially against the background of the increasing information density of the past three decades - since the breakthrough of the World Wide Web - the various Internet search engines and now developed chatbots - Critical Thinking is to be considered a key competence in university teaching. The promotion of Critical Thinking is one of the central educational tasks and is identified as a target category in the European Qualifications Framework for Lifelong Learning.',

That is plenty of time to get involved in all sorts of things—but instead, most of us spend that time watching TV. In a 294-person study from the University of Maryland, those with positive attitudes towards leisure activities, as well as active engagement generally feel healthier, and are more motivated to succeed. In short, we need to take a more active approach to our leisure time. And there are so many options—choice between an ever-growing number of leisure activities.

It involves external migration, which means movement across an internationally recognized border, i.e. moving from one country to the other or one continent to another.  Internal migration means movement within a recognized border, located in the same state or country, including rural migrations. There are some core truths and joys about country living and rural migrations. Urban areas typically have a large population, a high population density and much social and economic infrastructure and amenities.  Moving to a favourable rural area to live and work there discover once they’ve made the move.

    text: `Household chores are an unavoidable and fundamental part of domestic life. Over the years, the distribution of responsibilities has become more balanced, especially in modern families. In the past, repetitive tasks like vacuuming, dishwashing, and laundry were often the obligation of women. However, a 2021 survey showed that 68% of young adults aged 18 to 29 support equal division of chores between family members. Technological innovations have improved the efficiency of certain tasks. Since 2015, robotic vacuum cleaners and programmable devices have reduced time spent on cleaning. Nevertheless, duties like ironing or scrubbing bathroom tiles still require careful effort and patience. Experts argue that assigning manageable chores to children as young as three can enhance their sense of responsibility and make them more cooperative. Even simple actions, such as sorting recyclables or setting the dinner table, build useful habits and foster independence. Household chores, though often underestimated, play a key role in building life skills and shaping daily routines.`,

    text: `Shopping is a regular activity that influences many areas of modern life. People shop for food, clothes, electronics, and other daily necessities. Over the last two decades, online shopping has become increasingly popular. Since around 2010, websites and mobile apps have made it more convenient to compare prices, read reviews, and order items from home. However, shopping is not only about comfort and variety. It also requires responsibility. Smart shopping means planning your purchases, avoiding unnecessary spending, and recognizing the impact of consumer choices on the environment. For example, buying reusable products or supporting local businesses can help reduce waste and support the community. Young people are especially influenced by advertisements on social media platforms. A study in 2022 showed that 73% of teenagers are more likely to buy products recommended by influencers. This creates both opportunities and challenges, as trends change quickly and some items may not be affordable for everyone. Shopping habits can say a lot about a person’s values, budget, and lifestyle. Whether online or in a physical store, making thoughtful decisions helps shoppers feel more confident and prepared in everyday life.`,

    text: `Interpersonal relationships are a central part of human experience. Whether at school, at work, or within families, strong relationships are built on trust, communication, and mutual respect. But even healthy relationships can face challenges. For example, when people have different opinions or expectations, a conflict may arise. If not handled properly, it can lead to misunderstanding or distance. In these situations, the ability to listen carefully and show empathy becomes very important. It helps others feel heard and supported, even when there is disagreement. In one recent classroom survey from 2023, students were asked what helps them maintain positive relationships with friends. The most common answers were “being honest,” “sharing problems,” and “spending quality time together.” These responses show that emotional connection is often more important than having the same interests or opinions. A strong relationship doesn’t mean avoiding all problems—it means being supportive, patient, and willing to grow together. By developing these social skills, people become more confident and prepared for real-life situations, both personal and professional.`,

    text: `Living a healthy lifestyle is more than just eating vegetables and exercising. It involves making daily choices that support both physical and mental well-being. Unfortunately, many people face serious health problems due to unhealthy routines. Obesity is one of the most common issues today. It is often caused by overeating, lack of movement, and poor nutrition. People with obesity are at higher risk of heart problems, diabetes, and joint pain. In many cases, this condition begins in childhood and continues into adulthood. Another concern is insomnia, a sleep disorder that affects concentration, mood, and productivity. It is often linked to stress, screen time, or irregular sleep patterns. In severe cases, extreme exhaustion may lead to accidents or sudden unconsciousness. To live healthily, it’s important to sleep well, eat balanced meals, stay active, and avoid harmful habits like smoking. Even small changes—like drinking more water or walking daily—can improve one’s health over time. A healthy lifestyle helps people feel more energetic, focused, and emotionally balanced. It doesn’t require perfection—just consistency, awareness, and care for your own body and mind.`,

From the subtropical shores of Sochi to the frozen plains of Yakutsk, the climate varies greatly depending on location. The country experiences long winters, short summers, and strong seasonal variation, which makes it fascinating for tourists all year round. In Siberia, winters are extremely cold. Temperatures can drop below -50°C, and the ground stays frozen for most of the year. These snowy landscapes attract adventurous travelers interested in winter sports and unique nature experiences. In contrast, Krasnodar Krai in southern Russia offers a much milder climate. Summers are warm, and there is more precipitation throughout the year. The city of Sochi, located on the Black Sea coast, is famous for its beaches, mountain views, and subtropical weather—making it a popular resort destination. Russia’s climate is mostly continental, with hot summers and cold winters. This creates opportunities for skiing, hiking, sightseeing, and cultural tourism in every season. Despite the climate extremes, people have adapted through modern technology and building methods. For tourists, Russia’s varied climate provides a wide range of experiences—from snowy adventures to sunny coastal holidays.`,

    text: `Volunteering is a meaningful way to help others and make a positive difference in the community. People of all ages volunteer their time, energy, and skills to support various causes, such as education, healthcare, the environment, and animal protection. According to global studies, over 1 billion people worldwide participate in some form of volunteering each year. In 2022, approximately 26% of young adults between the ages of 16 and 25 took part in organized volunteer activities. These experiences help develop important life skills such as teamwork, communication, and responsibility. Volunteering can take many forms. Some people help out at local schools or libraries, while others work with charities or environmental groups. Even small efforts, like collecting donations or cleaning up parks, can have a big impact. Many organizations now offer digital volunteering, where people support projects online. This allows more flexible options for those with busy schedules. Besides helping others, volunteers often report feeling more confident and connected to their communities. Whether it’s a few hours a week or a few days a year, volunteering is a powerful way to give back, grow personally, and create a more caring and supportive world.`,

If you fall into the latter category, soft hiking is for you. If you want to stroll through the woods, stop to look at the scenery, pause for snacks — it all counts as hiking, even though it doesn't involve scrambling or buckets of sweat. The original post about soft hiking already has over 340,000 views, as well as comments that show just how much the trend strikes a chord. While seasoned hikers might look for a challenging trek, soft hiking is all about slowing down and meandering through nature. The key is to go slow, take in your surroundings, and stop for regular breaks. You should feel free to go off trail to look at a cool tree, pull over at an overlook to take photos, or explore a historical site. There's no need to rush or push or keep up with others. As long as you remain present, you are doing it right.`,

and over 1,000 people died, which made people start to ask questions about how and where their 
clothes were made. 
Some companies have strict rules about the factories that make their clothes, including H&M, 
Zara, and Primark, who say they only work with safe factories paying fair wages. But other 
companies don't have such strict rules. 
To be sure that your clothes are made fairly, you can buy second-hand clothes from shops or 
apps like Vinted and Depop, or choose ethical fashion brands like People Tree and Everlane, 
which may cost more but are better for the environment and the people who make them.
