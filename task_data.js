There is cross-disciplinary agreement on defining Critical Thinking as the ability to evaluate the content of information and to derive conclusions about the extent to which one can believe this information or discuss what one should think of it. Especially against the background of the increasing information density of the past three decades - since the breakthrough of the World Wide Web - the various Internet search engines and now developed chatbots - Critical Thinking is to be considered a key competence in university teaching. The promotion of Critical Thinking is one of the central educational tasks and is identified as a target category in the European Qualifications Framework for Lifelong Learning.'

But do we really enjoy our free time? On average, in Western society, we get about 5 hours of leisure time a day. That is plenty of time to get involved in all sorts of things—but instead, most of us spend that time watching TV. In a 294-person study from the University of Maryland, those with positive attitudes towards leisure activities, as well as active engagement generally feel healthier, and are more motivated to succeed. In short, we need to take a more active approach to our leisure time. And there are so many options—choice between an ever-growing number of leisure activities. So next time you’ve got some free time, take some time to think about what you’re doing, and why.'

Generally, the concept is defined as the movement or change from one geographical area to another, as well as across the border. It involves external migration, which means movement across an internationally recognized border, i.e. moving from one country to the other or one continent to another.  Internal migration means movement within a recognized border, located in the same state or country, including rural migrations. There are some core truths and joys about country living and rural migrations. Urban areas typically have a large population, a high population density and much social and economic infrastructure and amenities.  Moving to a favourable rural area to live and work there discover once they’ve made the move. However, the rates of such migrate movements differ, with generally high rates seen in developing nations.'
